Here are some instructions to put in mind during the course of the design process

A board can only be called a HAT if:
It conforms to the basic add-on board requirements
It has a valid ID EEPROM (including vendor info, GPIO map and valid device tree information).
It has a full size 40W GPIO connector.
It follows the HAT mechanical specification
It uses a GPIO connector that spaces the HAT between 10mm and 12mm from the Pi (i.e. uses spacers between 10mm and 12mm).
If back powering via the GPIO connector the HAT must be able to supply a minimum of 1.3A continuously to the Pi (but ability to supply 2A continuously recommended).
Other details you need to know:

There are specific GPIO sequencing that you need to be mindful of. By default, some pins are active at boot, so that can have unexpected results if there is no current limiting on whatever is connected to them.
On pins 27 and 28, do not connect anything other than an EEPROM that is to the defined spec. You can leave off the EEPROM, but that is no longer officially a HAT. As long as you don't connect anything to those pins, the Pi Foundation would still probably be supportive, but you can't say it is a HAT.
If you are back powering the Pi via the HAT, you need to not connect the 3.3V supply from the HAT to the Pi, and you need to put in protective components to prevent 5V via USB causing conflicting power issues.
So, that seems to be the lot of it, the Pi Foundation really tried to leave the rest as wide open as possible to let you be as clever as you want.
